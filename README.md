# The Century of Satire
Reconstructing 2nd century cultural literature context of Roman satire in Early Christianity texts

See reading sequence [Language Bias Hypotheses](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/sequences.md#language-bias-hypotheses) under the Path Semantics project.

The central essay is [In Saeculum Satyrarum - The Century of Satire](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/papers-wip2/the-century-of-satire.pdf).

### Main Hypothesis

In Path Semantics, the language bias hypothesis of Seshatism vs Platonism plays a significant important role
to understand the relationship between Infinite-Valued Logic (which has a model in [PSQ](https://advancedresearch.github.io/quality/summary.html#psq---path-semantical-quantum-propositional-logic)) and human biases.

The overall hypothesis of Seshatism is that human cultures are changing dynamically over time in language bias,
readapting existing ideas according to trends in language biases and reinterpreting texts in the past.

This hypothesis overlaps with the fundamental theory for Intellectual History, that ideas have a history.
Where Intellectual History studies ideas themselves, one can use Seshatism vs Platonism to study interpretation of ideas and perspectives influenced by language design.

The study of language bias is not merely history of ideas,
but attempt to classifying languages, whether they are mathematical, artistic or philosophic, according to language biases.
A formal language [Joker Calculus](https://github.com/advancedresearch/joker_calculus) is used to describe a bias
according to higher dualities of Seshatism vs Platonism.

### 2nd Century Early Christianity

Early Christianity in the 2nd century provides a good test case for developing the tools of language bias analysis.

New research in academic biblical scholarship suggests that the historical context of Early Christianity is important
for interpreting the texts (there are thousands of Early Christian writings) through the lens of the people who write them.

### Roman Satire

One of the things recently discovered is that some Early Christians write in the contemporary cultural genre of Roman satire.
This violates the expectations of Late Christianity that people wrote these texts with the intention of being serious.
Instead, one might view the texts as means to climb the social ladder, fit in with contemporary cultural movements
and to mimick signs of prestige in elite literacy.
