# Catacomb Paintings

To reconstruct 2nd century cultural literature context of Roman satire in Early Christian texts,
it is useful to study catacomb paintings. You can find more information under [Sources](#sources).

Catacomb paintings were part of a general ritual practice that started in the 2nd century.
There was a Roman ban on burial within city walls as a response to overcrowding and shortage of land.
All burial sites, including catacombs, where located outside the walls of the city.

The number of catacomb burials up until the 7th century are estimated to be > 6 500 000.

Geology: Catacombs were dug from soft volcanic rock covered by dirt or earth,
that hardens when it hits air, making it very stable to dig into.

The Christian catacombs contain the majority of examples of art from the period 100 - 400 AD.
They are not just important to study Christian art, but also Jewish art from the same period.

Christianity and Judaism co-evolved alongside each other in the 2nd century.
Their cultural identities are evolving from a broader religious practice called "Yahwism" by modern scholars.

The common ritual performed in catacombs was a family as part of their regular activity holding meals for the dead.
This ritual was common, regardless religion.
