# Catacomb Paintings

To reconstruct 2nd century cultural literature context of Roman satire in Early Christian texts,
it is useful to study catacomb paintings.

Catacomb paintings were part of a general ritual practice that started in the 2nd century.
There was a Roman ban on burial within city walls as a response to overcrowding and shortage of land.
All burial sites, including catacombs, where located outside the walls of the city.

The Christian catacombs contain the majority of examples of art from the period 100 - 400 AD.
They are not just important to study Christian art, but also Jewish art from the same period.

Christianity and Judaism co-evolved alongside each other in the 2nd century.
Their cultural identities are evolving from a broader religious practice called "Yahwism" by modern scholars.
