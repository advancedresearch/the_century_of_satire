# Applying Joker Calculus to Scholarship of Early Christianity

To reconstruct 2nd century cultural literature context of Roman satire in Early Christian texts,
it is useful to think critically about scholarship about this period through the perspective of language bias.

Scholars usually portrays themseves as objective, but whenever humans argue about a complex topic,
such as mathematics, philosophy or ethics,
they often have perspectives that correspond to some higher duality in [Joker Calculus](https://crates.io/crates/joker_calculus).
Instead of arguing why a particular scholar is right or wrong,
it is more useful to first enumerate terms in Joker Calculus and classify scholarship by tendency.
This way, one can better understand the language bias a scholar has.
However, this does not mean that the scholar commits to a particular bias, or does not write books from other perspectives.

There are two basis perspectives in scholarship of Early Christianity: History and Myth.
One can use Joker Calculus to construct higher dualities from these two perspectives.

### Overview

1. History (Christian Apologetics)
2. Myth (Robert M. Price)
3. Mythical History (Markus Vinzent)
4. Historical Myth (Carl A. P. Ruck)
5. Joker History (Miracles surrounding martyrs)
6. Joker Myth (Forgeries of Pauline epistles)
7. Historical Joker History (Bart D. Ehrman)
8. Mythical Joker Myth (Richard Carrier)
9. Mythical Joker History (Jennifer G. Bird)
10. Historical Joker Myth (Elaine Pagels)

### 1. History

Local example: [Christian Apologetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_apologetics)

Common fallacy: Over-emphasize the claimed historical events around Jesus, a Judean preacher.

Christian Apologetics is a local example of History bias,
where some claimed historical events are interpreted as actual historical events.

Early Christianity is not primarily about the Jesus, a Judean preacher.
It is a cultural literature context, spanning multiple savior figures, that takes place in space and time.

The proposition History bias refers to the overall development of Early Christianity,
but this includes all claims, including those who became considered as heretical in Late Christianity.

To refute History bias, scholars often appeal to the following arguments:

1.1. Contradicting assumptions of naturalism  
1.2. Contradicting claims from Early Christian texts  
1.3. Contradicting claims about authentic doctrine  

### 2. Myth

Example: [Robert M. Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Price)

Robert M. Price tends to take the position that Early Christianity must be seen through the lens of Myth bias.
He presents a nuanced view, but the Myth bias is his fallback position to any claim that has no evidence to support it.

2.1. Paul might have been renamed from Simon in Simonianism  
2.2. Similar claims of savior figures to Jesus but with other names  

### 3. Mythical History

Example: [Markus Vinzent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Vinzent)

Markus Vinzent's view of Early Christianity is that there are historical and political events that contribute
significantly to the mythical development:

3.1. Bar Kokhba revolt  
3.2. Marcion of Sinope's canon  

### 4. Historical Myth

Example: [Carl A. P. Ruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_A._P._Ruck)

Carl A. P. Ruck argues that Early Christianity is a Hellenistic religion, not a Jewish religion, with deeper roots in history.
His view of Jewish elements in Early Christianity is that the Jewish culture was used for esoteric aestethics.
Underneith this layer of Jewish esoteric aesthetics, he claims that Early Christianity is like other myths in the Hellenistic world.

4.1. Use of entheogens in rituals of mystery cults  
4.2. "Christ" as the Greek version "the annointed one" instead of using the Hebrew word "Messiah"  

### 5. Joker History

Example: Miracles surrounding martyrs in Early Christianity

`Joker History = (History <depth>, Myth <surface>)`

Joker History bias is the idea that history can be presented as myth.

In martyrdom, it is common to claim some kind of miracle surrounding the death of a martyr.
Even if the martyrdom could have happened historically, by including the miracle, history is presented as myth.

In general, scholars accepts this bias as a valid position,
since it occurs in many aspects in how Early Christianity gets developed.

### 6. Joker Myth

Example: Forgeries of Pauline epistles

`Joker Myth = (Myth <depth>, History <surface>)`

Joker Myth bias is the idea that myth can be presented as history.

It was common in Early Christianity by anonymous people to write texts that claimed to be written by e.g. some apostle.
This gives the text more credibility among contemporaries.

In general, scholars accepts this bias as a valid position,
since it occurs in many aspects in how Early Christianity gets developed.

### 7. Historical Joker History

Example: [Bart D. Ehrman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_D._Ehrman)

Bart D. Ehrman argues that Early Christianity was history, presented as myth,
but that the correct way of interpreting this bias is from the perspective of history.

### 8. Mythical Joker Myth

Example: [Richard Carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Carrier)

Richard Carrier argues that Early Christianity was myth, presented as history,
but that the correct way of interpreting this bias is from the perspective of myth.

Joker Calculus predicts that Bart D. Ehrman and Richard Carrier will disagree more strongly
which each other than with other scholars that hold different positions.

### 9. Mythical Joker History

Example: [Jennifer G. Bird](https://www.jennifergracebird.com/bio)

This is an embracing bias toward Myth.

Jennifer G. Bird argues that Early Christianity was history by focusing on the origin of Jesus, presented as myth,
but that the correct way of interpreting this bias is from the perspective of myth.
Her view is that Early Christianity has value for ex-Christians that accepts Jesus as mythologized savior figure,
but want to engage in the mythical perspective as a social activity.

### 10. Historical Joker Myth

Example: [Elaine Pagels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Pagels)

Elaine Pagels argues that Gnosticism is a made-up category that was indistinguishable from Early Christianity.
Her view is that Early Christianity is mostly myth, some aspects of it was history or presented as history,
but that the correct way of interpreting this bias is from the perspective of history.
The argument is that myths believed by many people were oppressed and viewed as herecy due to historical development.
