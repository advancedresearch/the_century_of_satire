# Applying Joker Calculus to Modern Christian Interpretion

To reconstruct 2nd century cultural literature context of Roman satire in Early Christian texts,
it is useful to construct a hypothesis of how modern Christians interpret the New Testament
in a way that helps to relate to how Early Christians wrote their texts.

### Introduction

I wrote this hypothesis as an essay with the esoteric title `0 (?1, 0)`.

In the essay, I use [Joker Calculus](https://crates.io/crates/joker_calculus) to explain the language bias
of how modern Christians interpret the New Testament.
This interpretation is not only intended to understand Christianity through the modern lens,
but also to relate to how Early Christians wrote their texts.

I also use things we know about Early Christianity from research:

- Sibylline oracles
- Logos from Platonism
- The Gospel of Mark written for some audience in Rome [*]

[*] This is disputed among scholars. Alternative: Antioch.

Footnotes refer to philosophers [Giless Deleuze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze),
[Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger) and [SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard).
These philosophical perspectives are related to Joker Calculus,
because Joker Calculus might be thought about as a formal language for unified large segments of Continental Philosophy.

### Essay: `0 (?1, 0)`

A little demonstration of Joker Calculus:

There is over 1 billion Christians in the world.
Christians are obsessed over the books in the New Testament.
How can we use Joker Calculus to describe how most Christians are reading these texts?

My answer is `0 (?1, 0)`.

Let us assign the following fundamental duals:

    0 = supernatural
    1 = natural

Using Joker Calculus, when interpreting the New Testament naively,
one might read it as about the supernatural `0`.
However, we know today that this was not how Early Christians thought about it.

The Early Christians produced texts among contemporaries,
claiming to come from older sources,
but contemporaries knew they were not.
This means, the texts can not be about the supernatural,
nor natural, yet they were religious texts, which means there is a higher duality bias.

Since the texts appears to be about the supernatural, one can infer that the surface level should be `0`.
Now, what should the depth surface level be? The easiest bias here is `1` (natural),
since Early Christians translated the supernatural metaphors into practical actions.

This means, in Joker Calculus one can assign the higher duality bias `?1` [*] to Early Christian texts.
However, since there is a different interpretation in modern Christianity, the bias to describe this situation is `(?1, 0)` [**].

[*] In Joker Calculus, `?1 = (1, 0)`, which means something that appears to be `0` but actually is `1`.

[**] In Joker Calculus, `(?1, 0)` means something that appears to be `0` but actually is `?1`.

I said previously that interpreting the texts *naively* was `0`.
I think it is more accurate to say that Christians in general read the texts as `(?1, 0)`.
Why? There are some things that are just not considered to be about the supernatural, because that would be too weird.

In the case when the New Testament claims something that is too weird,
Christians fall back to interpreting the text in the same way that Early Christians might do.
Instead of rejecting the text, they think of it as a metaphor for something natural, explained supernaturally.

This is where the bias `(?1, 0)` can help. On the surface, the text is interpreted to be about something supernatural,
but when this gets too weird, Christians go deeper and realize it is a metaphor.
They are trained in this way of thinking from young age.

However, when the New Testament claims something supernatural, most Christians think of it as a possibility
that when there is no evidence that does not directly contradict that it might be supernatural,
the text is allowed to be interpreted as about the supernatural.

So, `(?1, 0)` is not sufficient, because it does not tell you to interpret the text as supernatural by default.
This can be fixed by adding a perspective `0 (?1, 0)` [*].
This is very close the embracing bias `0 ?1`, but there is some nuance there that makes the difference [**].

[*] In Joker Calculus, `0 (?1, 0)` means `(?1, 0)` seen from the perspective of `0`.

[**] This difference can be thought of as Kierkegaard's repetition in sense of Deleuze's "Difference and Repetition".

Now, you might think that this `0 (?1, 0)` bias is a simplification, because it only treats the interpretation
along the basic dualities of natural vs supernatural.
However, the trick is that Joker Calculus is based on Seshatism vs Platonism originally.

The reason I assigned `0` to the supernatural, is because the supernatural is Platonic biased
and the standard encoding of Platonism in Joker Calculus is `0`.
So, when you replicate these steps, you can reach the same conclusion about the bias.

Seshatism vs Platonism is a much broader duality than the supernatural vs natural.
These two dualities are entire philosophies that are authentic [*] on their own.

[*] In sense of Heidegger, which has a trivial proof in Joker Calculus since they contain no Joker in the Closed variant.

We should not think that Christians in general relate to the texts in the New Testament along a singular dimension of duality.
I think it is more accurate to say that Christians apply multi-dimensional reasoning about duality in the interpretation.

To Early Christians, this was *obvious*, because they assigned,
if you simplify the different doctrines,
a feminine and masculine aspect to divinity.
The feminine aspect was Zoe, which means "life".
The masculine aspect was Logos, which means "word" or "reason".

In modern Christianity, it is common to stress the perspective that if the word does not become life,
then teaching Christianity is useless and without purpose.
I think they could have saved themselves this problem of stressing this issue, if they understood Early Christianity.

For Early Christians, it was not just a "secret knowledge" that the word had to become life,
but this was explicit doctrine among the initiated.
If you read e.g. The Gospel of Mark, the text is written to hide the "secret knowledge" from the reader.
Mark is an advertisement.

When Early Christians advertised for a school, they wrote a text that highlighted there was some secret knowledge to be learned,
which could only be accessed through the "proper" sect, or school of thought,
which was often literally a school in Rome, other places a metaphor.

In Rome during the 2nd century, Early Christianity might have been more economic motivated than in the remote regions of the empire.
Many scholars believe that The Gospel of Mark was written for an audience in Rome.
To understand Mark, one might think about it as advertisement.

The spiritual tradition that looks most like Early Christianity, are mystery cults.
This means, Mark might have been read out loud to advertise and supplemented with other texts that were only available to the initiated.
I think it is possible to reconstruct this philosophy.

In the texts of Sibylline oracles gathered in Alexandria, "Logos" is used in relation to the divine.
This is the earliest reference we have of a such explicit connection,
but one can also argue that it goes back to Platonism, pre-dating Early Christianity by centuries.

It is natural to assume that Paul writes to people living in places that are familiar with Sibylline oracles
and his theology is a variant to explain an older philosophical and spiritual tradition.
This made it easier for people to convert, by convincing them it was prophetized.

The Sibylline oracles had been around for a long time and this means that mystery cults in general
were familiar with the terms of connecting "Logos" to the divine.
This is also why The Gospel of John starts talking about Logos, to establish credibility using familiar terms.

One should not think that Logos as Jesus is a Platonic idea that was added later in Early Christianity,
but that Logos as divine was already established when Early Christianity starts to spread.
Logos is not a theologization of Jesus, but Jesus is a personification of Logos.

This was how Early Christians could establish themselves, by appealing to an older philosophical and
spiritual tradition which gave them credibility among contemporaries,
that ran mystery cults similar to their own.
The gospels of Jesus are advertisements for these new cults.

In modern Christianity, when talking about word becoming life, it sounds like there is some added philosophical dimension,
but actually this idea goes back to before Early Christianity and was part of the reason why Early Christianity could spread in the first place.

One can think about Early Christianity as successfully developing marketing skills for an existing philosophical and spiritual tradition.
Now, there is a reason that Zoe did not become part of modern Christianity: Monotheism out-competed Polytheism.

Since most cults were Polytheistic, it was more difficult for people to convert from Monotheism than it was for Polytheists to convert to Monotheism.
In Early Christianity there was Polytheism, but over time it turns into Monotheism because it was more successful.

Now, using the code `0 (?1, 0)`, one can understand why this particular interpretation of the New Testament was successful:
It is heavily biased toward Monotheism, but buried deep inside there is a small dash of Polytheism.
The Logos is the brand of the secret Zoe.

Early Christians understood Zoe as an aspect of the divine which was non-verbal.
It was not something meant to be said.
Therefore, Zoe could be suppressed completely and removed from the doctrine without
the new religion losing its appeal. The "secret knowledge" became life.
