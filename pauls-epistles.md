# Paul's Epistles

To reconstruct 2nd century cultural literature context of Roman satire in Early Christian texts,
it is useful to critically examine the earliest source about Christianity.

[Paul's Epistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_epistles) consists of 7 letters written by one person:

1. Galatians (c. 48 AD)
2. First Thessalonians (c. 49–51 AD)
3. First Corinthians (c. 53–54 AD)
4. Second Corinthians (c. 55–56 AD)
5. Romans (c. 55–57 AD)
6. Philippians (c. 57–59 AD or c. 62 AD)
7. Philemon (c. 57–59 AD or c. 62 AD)

These 7 letters were first published by Marcion of Sinope around 140 - 144 AD,
plus 3 other letters claimed to have been written by Paul.

### Pre-Marcion Early Christianity

Marcion of Sinope's canon influences Early Christian texts significantly from mid 2nd century.

Before this canon, there are none records of Early Christian texts that speaks about the resurrection of Jesus in the sense of Paul.

From a ritual reported by Pliny the Younger in 110 AD and from doctrine taught in competing sects considered herecy by later orthodox Christians,
Early Christians might have sung hymns to Venus before dawn and thought of Jesus as "Logos", a philosophical concept from Platonism.

### Dating of Paul's epistles

[The dating of Paul's epistles](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/mna9ea/an_update_on_dating_pauls_letters_without_acts/)
are based on 3 points, if the original Romans ends with chapter 14:

1. Paul claims to know James, brother of Jesus
2. Paul claims to been arrested in Damascus under King Aretas
3. Clement of Rome refers Paul's death in the past-tense

When including other chapters of Romans there are 2 more points:

4. Paul mentions greeting Erastus, treasurer of the city of Corinth
5. Paul says he was preaching in Illyricum (dissolved in 80 AD)

### Critical perspective of Jesus' historicity

The historical reliability of Paul being arrested in Damascus under King Aretas IV could be wrong.
This means, from a critical perspective there is only the claim of Jesus having a brother,
plus that Clement of Rome refers to Paul's death in the past-tense that points to Jesus' historicity.

There are none Early Christian texts that claim to have met Paul in person.
Neither do we have the name of any ordinary poor Early Christian from the 2nd century.

Marcion of Sinope joined a Simonian school under Cerdo when arriving in Rome.
Marcion claimed to be a follower of Paul.
This suggests that the savior figure in Simonianism, Simon Magus, might have been an influence of stories about Paul.

There are other texts that are written in the name of Paul during the 2nd century, which are known forgeries.
Late Christianity had a lot of incentive and did fabricate false evidence about Jesus' historicity.

### Mythicism as a reasonable position

Given that Early Christians before Marcion of Sinope's canon seems to relate to Jesus in a way
that can be understood through rituals performed by similar mystery cults,
Occham's razor suggests that Early Christianity largely based their texts on myths.

Among some of the possibilities of Mythicism positions are:

1. Paul might not have been a historical person
2. No people Paul knew, met a historical Jesus

The position 1) implies 2), but not vice versa.

The probability of Jesus' historicity `JH` argued through Paul's epistles `PE` is calculated using the following:

`P(JH | PE) = 1 - P(1) * P(2 | 1)`

For example, by assigning 50% to both 1) and 2), one gets only 25%.

If you are completely uncertain about Jesus' historicity,
then you give some confidence to either that Paul existed historically
or that Paul knew somebody who met a historical Jesus.
This is a common assumption made by most people,
but it also shows that it is not a strong argument in favor of Jesus' historicity.

Without any evidence for low probability of 1) and 2), Mythicism becomes reasonable by default.

Even when assigning low probability to both 1) and 2),
there is a lot of evidence that Early Christian texts are at least partially based on myths.
This means Mythicism is a reasonable position to consider Early Christian texts as a first order approximation,
even when taking evidence of Jesus' historicity into account.
