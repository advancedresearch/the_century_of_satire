# Source Criticism

To reconstruct 2nd century cultural literature context of Roman satire in Early Christian texts,
it is useful to reason carefully about the sources of Early Christianity.

1. There is no recorded name of any ordinary, poor Early Christian in the 2nd century
2. There is no reliable external reference to Christianity from the 1st century
3. There is no reliable method to distinguish reliable oral traditions from unreliable sources

### 1. There is no recorded name of any ordinary, poor Early Christian in the 2nd century

If we do not have the name of a single ordinary, poor Early Christian in the 2nd century,
then why should we believe that we know the historicity of any poor Early Christian in the 1st century?

The problem is that the story of Jesus' life is not like a story about an ordinary person,
but an extra-ordinary supernatural person who performs miracles.

If this story was based on some historical figure who is poor and ordinary, then this is a claim, not based on any texts,
that people would name poor and ordinary folks in their texts or oral tradition in the 1st century and remember them.

However, in principle it would be OK with stories about extra-ordinary people as long as it names poor and ordinary people in them,
as long those poor and ordinary people could be verified using external sources.
If a such tradition existed in the 1st century, then why does not this tradition continue in the 2nd century?
We do not even have the names of any poor and ordinary people verified by external sources in 2nd century stories about extra-ordinary people.

The fact that we do not know the name of a single ordinary, poor Early Christian in the 2nd century,
is an even stronger indication there is no tradition for remembering ordinary people, even in the 2nd century.

Hence, to claim a such tradition in the 1st century, both lacks evidence in the 2nd century and
is negated on its own by the fact that the stories that are claimed to be from 1st century are about extra-ordinary people.

This argument might be hard to follow, but basically it suggests that 1st century stories in Early Christianity are myths.
Yet, that the 1st century stories are myths, is not conclusive without considering other evidence.

### 2. There is no reliable external reference to Christianity from the 1st century

The only text written by a non-Christian that mentions Christianity from the 1st century is written by Josephus.
All the other external references are written in the 2nd century after the death of Josephus.

However, Josephus does not talk or mentions Christians in general.

The only 1st century references to Christianity in Josephus are in Antiquities of the Jews, written around AD 93â€“94.
It contains two references to Jesus of Nazareth and one reference to John the Baptist.

John the Baptist was executed in the last year of Pilate's prefecture over Judea.
This means, Jesus could not have been executed by Pilate 3 years after the death of John the Baptist.

So, there is no reliable evidence that Jesus of Nazareth in Josephus was executed
in a way that can be confirmed with a realistic chronology of the 1st century using external sources.
This in itself is not a big deal, but it is important for the bigger picture:
It undermines the only written external reference to Christianity, overall, in the 1st century.

### 3. There is no reliable method to distinguish reliable oral traditions from unreliable sources

A common argument used to give credence to Early Christian writings is to appeal to some reliable oral tradition.

While such reliable oral traditions might have existed, the actual problem is distinguishing them from other unreliable sources:

1. Identification of Jesus' actions and quotes with other mythical figures
2. Sayings by oracles
3. Claimed direct spiritual revelation
4. Texts that are written in names of the apostles or disciples of Jesus

It is easy to forget that without biblical scholarship,
people today would still claim reliable transmission
from texts that scholars know to be forgeries.

In principle, before biblical scholarship started doing research,
all the texts being passed down could have been forgeries.
It is just sheer luck that some of the texts might not been forgeries,
after eliminating those who were not original texts.

It does not help to know that some reliable oral tradition is possible,
if you can not distinguish such transmission from other less reliable transmissions.

The arguments that some texts are forgeries, are based on internal evidence of other texts.
However, such arguments can not prove authenticity of original texts,
only demonstrate why some texts are likely forgeries, relative to other texts that might be original.
